This project presents the development of a full-stack educational application designed to enhance teaching methodologies through interactive quizzes that provide students with rewards for good performance. The system supports multiple question types, including multiple-choice single-select, multiple-choice multi-select, and true/false questions. Additionally, it implements access control mechanisms to ensure that only students enrolled in specific classes can take particular quizzes. Key features include separation of permissions between students and teachers, class enrollments, quiz creation, point tracking, rewards, achievements, and secure access controls. The application is built with a focus on scalability, usability, and adaptability to future enhancements. 

The project encompasses the design and implementation of both front-end and back-end components, including user interface development, API design, and database integration. By leveraging modern web technologies and best practices in software development - in particular, the explicit consideration of software architecture when making design decisions - this application provides an engaging and efficient platform for teachers and students alike. This report details the development process, key features, and future directions to demonstrate the system's potential as a robust educational tool.
